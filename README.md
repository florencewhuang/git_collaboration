**Both merges above are fast-forward merges. Explain**: In a fast forward merge you will only see one path. The branches will not diverge because the main branch just needs to catch up
**In your own words, write down a scenario that will involve a merge conflict between develop and conflict_branch**: Changing titles in both branches without pulling any previous changes can create merge conflicts when trying to push separate changes. 
**In your own words, write down a scenario that will NOT involve a merge conflict between develop and conflict_branch despite some change on the same file on both branches.**: There would not be a merge conflict if we push and pull between each change on the file. Additionally if you make changes in two different places then when merging it together there won't be a conflict.
